    It looks like you may be asking about orchids.

    Phalaenopsis orchids grow on trees in the wild and need air flow around their roots. They are usually kept in coarse bark chips in pots with lots of drainage holes as soil suffocates their roots. Water orchids by submerging the pot in room temperature water for about 15 minutes and then let it drain. Make sure there is no water pooling in the crown of the leaves.

    Do this when the membrane covering the roots is silvery and dry. Hydrated roots are green, plump, and mottled. Cut off roots that don't plump up after watering and roots that are black and slimy. Keep the plant in bright indirect light.

    Orchid flowers die after a while, that is normal. Cut off the flower stalk when it is dead. The orchid should flower again but it can take several months. Add orchid fertilizer to the water when you see a new flower stalk forming to prolong the flowering. Replace the bark about once a year.

    Your plant is suffering from an infestation of [fungus gnats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus_gnat). A first step in a fungus gnat outbreak should be yellow sticky traps to catch adult bugs, and letting the soil dry out to kill larvae. Bottom watering may assist with future management. Bacillus thuringiensis var. Israelensis (Bti) dunks may also be considered for persistent infestations [More here](https://extension.umd.edu/resource/fungus-gnats)

    Bumps growing on the back of fern leaves are sori (sg. sorus) The contain sporangia, which produces spores, and also hold the spores until they're ready to be released. Ferns don't have flowers, they reproduce with spores. The spores themselves are too small to be seen by the naked eye. Fern spores are harmless.

### Auto-responder for under-watering

#type: comment
#body (includes-word): '!under-water'
#comment: |
#    Found advice keyword: `{{match}}`

#    Symptoms: Under-watering can present as drooping leaves and stems, and leaves turning brown and dry from the edges in.

#    Treatment: The easiest way to fix under-watering is to water your plant more frequently. If your plant hasn't been watered in a while, the soil won't absorb water easily. A good way to fix this is bottom-watering (comment `!bottom-watering` to learn more). If your plant responds well to watering but seems to dry out quickly, this could mean that it is becoming root-bound and there isn't much soil left to retain moisture. If this is the case you should re-pot your plant into a larger container.

### Auto-responder for over-watering

#    Found advice keyword: `{{match}}`

#    Symptoms: Over-watering can present as yellow or brown droopy leaves, a mushy base or stem, or fungus growing on the surface of your soil.

#    Treatment: Reducing your watering frequency is often enough to fix this. Try not to water your plant on a fixed schedule, instead adhering to a care system specific for your plant species and environment. For most house plants a good baseline is waiting until the top few inches of the soil are dry before watering, with longer times for cacti and other succulents. If your plant's soil remains moist long after watering and it still displays symptoms of over-watering, root rot may have set in.

### Auto-responder for root-rot

#type: comment
#body (includes-word): '!root-rot'
#comment: |
#    Found advice keyword: `{{match}}`

#    Symptoms: Root rot can present as over-watering in the early stages (yellow/brown drooping leaves, visible fungus). As it progresses you may see the plant look under-watered even as the soil stays wet. This is a sign the roots have rotted and are no longer able to absorb water.

#    Treatment: Early stages of root rot can sometimes be treated by completely changing your plant's soil and avoiding watering for a few days. Note that this will likely cause transplant shock, so it's only a good option when your plant is still relatively healthy and it will look worse before it gets better. In the later stages the only option is to propagate your plant so a piece of it has a chance to survive.

#comment: |
#    Found advice keyword: `{{match}}`

#    Some plants and tropical plants in particular, need more humidity than is found in the average home. Relative humidity levels vary greatly by geographic location and tend to be lower in winter, particularly with central heat and air conditioning. A hygrometer can help you determine humidity levels. Many local nurseries carry them or they can be found online.

#    Unfortunately, misting and pebble trays do not increase humidity for plants. Placing your plant in a bathroom or kitchen may help if there is enough light. A humidifier is usually the best option for plants that need increased humidity. A cloche or plant cover can also increase humidity.

### Auto-responder for tap water

#    Found advice keyword: `{{match}}`

#    Certain plants are highly sensitive to chemicals commonly found in tap water, such as excess chlorine, fluoride, limescale, and those resulting from water-softening. ​

#    There is no need to let water sit overnight before using it on plants. This has been recommended as a way to let chlorine evaporate, but there generally isn’t enough chlorine in tap water to harm most plants, and allowing portions of tap water to evaporate may increase mineral concentrations in the remaining water. ​

#    If you have soft water, you can use it to water your houseplants, but be sure to flush the salts that can accumulate in the potting mix once a month or so. Simply pour water into the pot until it runs out the bottom; wait for it to drain completely and then repeat the process.

#    When using tap water, use room temperature water to avoid shocking the plant. Alternatively, rain water, bottled water, or distilled water may be used.

### Auto-responder for dense soil

#type: comment
#body (includes-word): '!dense-soil'
#comment: |
#    Found advice keyword: `{{match}}`

#    Symptoms: The substrate your plant is in is staying wet too long. This can lead to symptoms similar to over-watering and eventually root rot. Things like mushrooms or fuzzy molds/fungi will commonly be seen growing in dense or highly organic soils.

#    Treatment: Try adding things like perlite, vermiculite, orchid bark, or horticultural charcoal to your soil to help with drainage and aeration. For cactus and other desert plants, things like coarse sand or fine pumice will also help improve soil texture. Adding stones to the bottom of the pot is not recommended, as water can sit stagnant at the bottom of the pot.

### Auto-responder for hydrophobic soil

#type: comment
#body (includes-word): '!hydrophobic'
#comment: |
#    Found advice keyword: `{{match}}`

#    Over time, potting substrates can become hydrophobic, meaning they repel rather than absorb water. This is most common with peat based products. Water may bead on the soil surface or runs straight through drainage holes if it has gone hydrophobic.

#    If you suspect your soil may not be retaining water and nutrients, water your plant and carefully remove it from the pot. If there are dry spots in the soil after a few minutes, consider repotting or refreshing the soil.

#    When plants are exposed to extreme cold, the plant cells expand and burst. This process is irreversible, and the affected portions of the plant will die.

#    Remove cold-damaged portions of the plant and allow the plant to return to room temperature naturally. Reduce watering frequency unless and until the plant begins to put out new growth from portions of the plant (including roots) that did not fully freeze.

### Auto-responder for repot

#type: comment
#body (includes-word): '!repot'
#comment: |
#    Found advice keyword: `{{match}}`

#    When plants become root-bound, (roots encircling the pot and poking out of drainage holes), it's time to repot. Sometimes roots will emerge above the soil surface and the plant will look like it's trying to squeeze out of its pot. Every plant will have different needs, but in general only go up one pot size when repotting. Very gently remove as much of the old soil as possible. If dealing with stubborn soil, the root ball can be soaked in a bucket of room temperature settled water for a few hours before repotting. As a rule of thumb the next size pot will only be about 1/2 inch or 13mm larger. Most houseplants only need about 1/4" to 1/2" between the container wall and the root system. Using a container that is too large can create issues by retaining too much water or taking too long to dry out. This can lead to fungal and pest issues.

#    Some plants prefer to be slightly root-bound or snug in their pots. As a general rule underpotting a plant is preferable to overpotting a plant.

#    To refresh soil, simply remove the old soil, soak if needed and reuse the same pot with new potting medium.

#    Bottom watering is a common practice to help water the entire volume of soil. The capillary action will draw water up through the holes in the bottom of the pot and soak the soil all the way through. Set the potted plant in a bucket of water for as long as it takes for the top soil to be damp.

#    Some plants can be propagated from cuttings in soil. For the best chances, take a cutting with a few leaf nodes with the cut made at an angle. Place the cutting in container with a majority inorganic composition (perlite or vermiculite are recommended) and add water. Place in a high-humidity environment, or cover with a plastic bag to trap humidity inside.

#comment: |
#    Found advice keyword: `{{match}}`

#    Cacti and succulents can be propagated from offsets, stem cuttings, or leaves depending on the species. In all cases, the cutting should be left to callous over for a few days before further steps are taken in order to prevent rot.

#    Offsets and stem cuttings should be placed directly in soil after the callous has formed. Do not water the cutting until the first roots have formed; this can take weeks to months.

#    There are two methods for propagating leaves:

#    1.  Place leaves on a shallow dish filled with cactus soil after the callous has formed. Mist infrequently until the first roots have formed; this can take weeks to months. After the first roots have formed, plant in cactus soil and water infrequently.

#    2. Plant leaves directly in soil and wait for roots to form. Water lightly once a month after first root growth is observed.
